		<p id="p1"><font color="000000">O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
<br>
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
<br>
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
<br>
But O heart! heart! heart!
<br>
O the bleeding drops of red,
<br>
Where on the deck my Captain lies,
<br>
Fallen cold and dead.
<br>
O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
<br>
Rise up- for you the flag is flung- for you the bugle trills,
<br>
For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths- for you the shores a-crowding,
<br>
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
<br>
Here Captain! dear father!
<br>
This arm beneath your head!
<br>
It is some dream that on the deck,
<br>
You’ve fallen cold and dead.
<br>
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
<br>
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
<br>
The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
<br>
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
<br>
Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
<br>
But I with mournful tread,
<br>
Walk the deck my Captain lies,
<br>
Fallen cold and dead.</p>
